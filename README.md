# meme_gen
Chrome extension to create memes from images on a page.

Current functionality allows people to simple open the extension and see all the images greater than 60px height. 


Some issues I am aware of:
* at times the focus for the caption inputs is not working right. Entering information works fine though.
* long caption is not going to the next line, but rather extends past the area of the canvas.
* not adhering to the color scheme (dark/light)


Nice to have:
* settings menu for image sizes to drop
* settings menu for colorscheme
* rotating text
* drag text placement
